# Horiseon-code-refactor

My goal in this refactor:
    - Make the existing website more accessible by renaming div tags into something more accessible by screen readers
    - Fix any existing user experience / navigation issues on the existing page

Execution:
    - Renamed the 4 main divs into their appropriate tag names (header, main, aside, footer)
    - Fixed a broken `href` attribute in an `a` tag
    - added `alt` tags for images

Noteworthy:
    - I am now better with Git commits and am using them more in my next project!
    - Semantics can be hard to nail correctly because of the nature of semantics :P at least there are best practices and general guidelines!
    - I don't fully understand the best practices of alt tags yet.
